Version =0.5.0= has been tagged.

New conditions added:

- =CLINGON:BASE-ERROR=
- =CLINGON:EXIT-ERROR= (sub-class of =CLINGON:BASE-ERROR=)

New generic functions added:

- =CLINGON:HANDLE-ERROR=

The =CLINGON:BASE-ERROR= condition can be used as the base for new
user-defined conditions, which can be signalled by command handlers.

Whenever a =CLINGON:BASE-ERROR= condition is signalled, the
=CLINGON:RUN= method will invoke =CLINGON:HANDLE-ERROR=, which allows
developers to provide custom logic for reporting and handling of app
specific errors.

Make sure to check the =Custom Errors= section from the documentation
for some examples on how to create user-defined conditions.

The utility function =CLINGON:EXIT= will not exit if the REPL is
connected via SLY or SLIME, which allows for better interactive
testing of the final application.

=clingon= version =0.4.0= has been tagged.

- Added Github Actions to automatically test the =clingon= system.
- Exported =CLINGON:PARSE-INTEGER-OR-LOSE=
- Export symbols to control the default list of options for newly
  created commands. See [[https://github.com/dnaeon/clingon/issues/4][issue #4]]
- =CLINGON:FIND-OPTION= can now search for options by their keys
- =CLINGON:GETOPT= returns three values -- the option value, a boolean
  indicating whether the option was set, and the command which
  provided the option.
- If =--version= is specified for any command, then =clingon= will try
  to find a parent command with an associated version string, if the
  sub-command does not provide it's own version string.
- Added =CLINGON:GETOPT*= which will return the first value from the
  command's lineage, for which the option was defined and set.
- Added =CLINGON:IS-OPT-SET-P*= predicate
- Additional tests related to =CLINGON:GETOPT= and =CLINGON:GETOPT*=
- Added support for /persistent/ options. A /persistent/ option is an
  option which is propagated from parent to all sub-commands. Please
  refer to the documentation for more details and examples.
- =CLINGON:PRINT-DOCUMENTATION= can generate the tree representation
  for commands in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)][Dot]] format.

This is how the generated tree for the =clingon-demo= app looks like.

* 2022-03-25

Added support for =pre-hook= and =post-hook= actions for commands.

The =CLIGON:COMMAND= class now accepts the =:pre-hook= and
=:post-hook= initargs, which allows specifying a function to be
invoked before and after the respective handler of the command is
executed.

The generic function =CLINGON:APPLY-HOOKS= have been added, which
takes care of applying the =pre-hook= and =post-hook= hooks.

Version of =clingon= system has been bumped to 0.3.5.

* 2022-03-24

Add support for grouping related options into categories.

The =:category= initarg for =CLINGON:OPTION= is used for specifying
the option's category.

New option kind has been added - =:list/filepath=.

The =clingon-demo= and =clingon-intro= binaries are now installed into
the =bin/= directory.

Additional utility functions have been implemented as part of the
=CLINGON.UTILS= package.

=clingon= system updated to version 0.3.3.
